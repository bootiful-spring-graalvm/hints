# GraalVM Spring Native Hints 

This project serves as an aggregation of all the [various  Spring Native hints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-native/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) I've built out for various components in the java ecosystem that don't necessarily fit in Spring Native or in Spring Boot. 

Then create a [Spring Native-aware project on the Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.6.3&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=com.example&artifactId=demo&name=demo&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.demo&dependencies=native) and enjoy!
