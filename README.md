# Spring Boot 3 AOT GraalVM Hints  

This project serves as an aggregation of all the [various  Spring Boot AOT hints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/) I've built out for various components in the java ecosystem that don't necessarily fit in Spring Native or in Spring Boot. 

Then create a [Spring Boot 3 project on the Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io), and enjoy!

## Deprecations 

This projects is now targeting Spring Boot 3, not Spring Native, as that work has been subsumed as part of the Spring Boot 3 release, which shipped in November 2022. 

I got support for the official Kubernetes Java client already merged into that codebase, so there's no point in supporting it here.

I got support for GraphQL merged into the Spring for GraphQL and Spring Boot GraphQL starter, so there's no point in supporting that here, either.
